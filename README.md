# Docs Extension Pack

A collection of extensions for writing, editing, and reviewing documentation in VS Code

These are some of my favorite extensions to make docs writing easier and fun, and improves my workflow.

## Extensions Included

- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker&WT.mc_id=marketplace-pack-sdras) - A fairly no-fuss spell checker that alerts you to misspelled words and detects camelCase code. Pretty invaluable :)
- [Grammarly (unofficial)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=znck.grammarly&WT.mc_id=marketplace-pack-sdras) - allows you to work with Grammarly in VS Code, not for everyone but easy to disable.
- [Gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens&WT.mc_id=marketplace-pack-sdras) - GitLens helps you to visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and more.
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode&WT.mc_id=marketplace-pack-sdras) - Never worry about formatting your code ever again, keep everything consistent with ease. My suggestion is to add `"editor.tabCompletion": true, "editor.formatOnSave": true,` to your settings file in preferences.
- [Formatting toggle](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tombonnike.vscode-status-bar-format-toggle&WT.mc_id=marketplace-pack-sdras) This one is a lifesaver! I love Prettier, but there are times I'm submitting PRs to repos with different formatting rules than I have. Rather than having to either shut off Prettier entirely, update my preferences to match theirs, or submit a noisy PR, I can use this extension to toggle formatting with a quickkey and get everything in! I love it.
- [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2&WT.mc_id=marketplace-pack-sdras) - This extension allows matching brackets to be identified with colours. The user can define which characters to match, and which colours to use. Super handy!
- [Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks&WT.mc_id=marketplace-pack-sdras) - Adds a bookmark to places you designate in your file, and allows you to quickly jump between them. Super helpful. Type `command + opt + K` to create a bookmark and `command + opt + J` to jump between them üîñ
- [Jumpy](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmaurer.vscode-jumpy&WT.mc_id=marketplace-pack-sdras) - We lose a lot of time scanning with a mouse, time we can get back by using our keyboard instead. Jumpy provides fast cursor movement by giving you a couple of keys that offer a hook to get to another part of the document.
- [In Bed By 7pm](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.inbedby7pm&WT.mc_id=marketplace-pack-sdras) Syntax highlighting can be a very personal thing, so you might not want to use this, but I worked hard creating a theme you might like.
